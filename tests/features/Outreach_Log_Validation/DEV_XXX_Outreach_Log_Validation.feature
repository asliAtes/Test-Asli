Feature: Outreach Log File Validation and Delivery
  The system should validate and deliver outreach log files to USCC in the correct format, with proper encryption, and ensure delivery to both SFTP and S3.

  Background:
    Given the outreach log generation service is running
    And test data is prepared for outreach log validation

  @DEV-XXX-TC1 @automated @file-format
  Scenario: Validate line endings in outreach log file
    When an outreach log file is generated
    Then all lines should end with CR+LF characters
    And the file should not have a ".crlf" extension

  @DEV-XXX-TC2 @automated @content-validation
  Scenario: Validate content structure of outreach log file
    When an outreach log file is generated
    Then the file should include headers
    And the file should not contain null values
    And the file should end with an empty row

  @DEV-XXX-TC3 @automated @scheduling
  Scenario: Validate outreach log generation on specific days
    When the system date is set to "Monday"
    Then the outreach log file should be generated
    And the file should follow all format requirements

  @DEV-XXX-TC4 @automated @field-validation
  Scenario Outline: Validate field formats in outreach log
    When an outreach log file is generated with "<field_type>" data
    Then the field should be properly formatted
    And no null values should be present in the field

    Examples:
      | field_type    |
      | phone_number  |
      | account_id    |
      | timestamp     |
      | message_id    |

  @DEV-XXX-TC5 @automated @performance
  Scenario: Validate performance with large data volume
    When a large volume of records is processed
    Then the outreach log should be generated within the expected timeframe
    And all format requirements should be maintained

  @DEV-XXX-TC6 @automated @error-handling
  Scenario: Handle null values in required fields
    When an outreach log file is generated with null values in required fields
    Then the records with null values should be excluded
    And the test should report which fields were null

  @DEV-XXX-TC7 @automated @encryption
  Scenario: Validate PGP encryption
    When an outreach log file is generated
    Then the file should be properly encrypted with PGP
    And the encrypted file should be decryptable with the provided key

  @DEV-XXX-TC8 @automated @delivery
  Scenario: Validate file delivery to SFTP and S3
    When an outreach log file is generated
    Then the file should be delivered to SFTP
    And the file should be delivered to S3
    And the file should be delivered to both staging and production environments

  @DEV-XXX-TC9 @automated @holiday
  Scenario: Validate empty file generation on holidays
    When the system date is set to a holiday
    Then an empty outreach log file should be generated
    And the file should contain only headers and a blank row
    And the file should follow all format requirements

  @DEV-XXX-TC10 @automated @sunday
  Scenario: Validate empty file generation on Sundays
    When the system date is set to Sunday
    Then an empty outreach log file should be generated
    And the file should contain only headers and a blank row
    And the file should follow all format requirements

  @DEV-XXX-TC11 @manual @real-data
  Scenario: Validate with real production data
    Given I have access to real production data
    When I run the outreach log validation with real data
    Then all validation checks should pass
    And no null values should be present in required fields
    And the file should be properly delivered to all destinations

  @DEV-XXX-TC12 @manual @integration
  Scenario: End-to-end validation of file generation and delivery
    Given the system is configured for production
    When the outreach log generation process runs
    Then the file should be generated with correct format
    And the file should be properly encrypted
    And the file should be delivered to all destinations
    And the delivery should be verified

  @DEV-XXX-TC13 @automated @error-handling @mock-data
  Scenario Outline: Handle invalid data types in outreach log
    When an outreach log file is generated with invalid "<data_type>"
    Then the error should be logged
    And the process should continue with valid records
    And the invalid record should be reported

    Examples:
      | data_type        |
      | malformed_json   |
      | invalid_phone    |
      | missing_required |
      | incorrect_format |

  @DEV-XXX-TC14 @automated @delivery @sftp @mock-data
  Scenario: Validate SFTP delivery permissions and backup
    When the outreach log file is delivered to SFTP
    Then the file permissions should be correct
    And a backup copy should be maintained

  @DEV-XXX-TC15 @manual @real-data
  Scenario: Validate error handling with real production data
    Given I have access to real production data with invalid records
    When I run the outreach log validation
    Then errors should be logged for invalid records
    And valid records should be processed and delivered
    And the invalid records should be reported
