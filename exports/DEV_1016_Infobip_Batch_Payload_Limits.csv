"Issue Type","Summary","Test Type","Gherkin"
"Test","Batch size at maximum limit","Functional","Given the Communication Module is integrated with Infobip Messages API
Given I prepare a batch of 100 SMS messages for Infobip
When I submit the batch to the Communication Module
Then the request should be accepted by Infobip
And no splitting should occur"
"Test","Batch size exceeds maximum limit","Functional","Given the Communication Module is integrated with Infobip Messages API
Given I prepare a batch of 120 SMS messages for Infobip
When I submit the batch to the Communication Module
Then the batch should be split into 2 requests
And each request should contain no more than 100 messages
And all messages should be accepted by Infobip"
"Test","Payload size just under 4MB","Functional","Given the Communication Module is integrated with Infobip Messages API
Given I prepare a batch of messages with total payload size just under 4MB
When I submit the batch to the Communication Module
Then the request should be accepted by Infobip
And no splitting should occur"
"Test","Payload size exceeds 4MB","Functional","Given the Communication Module is integrated with Infobip Messages API
Given I prepare a batch of messages with total payload size over 4MB
When I submit the batch to the Communication Module
Then the batch should be split into multiple requests
And each request should not exceed 4MB
And all messages should be accepted by Infobip"
"Test","Infobip rejects batch due to size limits","Negative","Given the Communication Module is integrated with Infobip Messages API
Given I prepare a batch that exceeds Infobip's limits
When I submit the batch to the Communication Module
Then the system should retry with smaller batch sizes
And logs or alerts should indicate the reason for rejection"
"Test","Logging and alerting when limits are exceeded","Functional","Given the Communication Module is integrated with Infobip Messages API
Given I prepare a batch that exceeds either the batch size or payload size limit
When I submit the batch to the Communication Module
Then the system should log or alert that the batch was split due to limit constraints"
