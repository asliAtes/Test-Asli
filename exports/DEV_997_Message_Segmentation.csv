"Issue Type","Summary","Test Type","Gherkin"
"Test","Long message should include segmentation information","Functional","Given the communication module is accessible
Given I prepare a standard SMS message request for DEV-997
And I set message content to be 800 characters
When I submit the SMS request to verify segmentation
Then the SMS response should have status code 200
And the response should include segment count information
And the segment count should match the expected formula"
"Test","Very long message should include segmentation information","Functional","Given the communication module is accessible
Given I prepare a standard SMS message request for DEV-997
And I set message content to be 1600 characters
When I submit the SMS request to verify segmentation
Then the SMS response should have status code 200
And the response should include segment count information
And the segment count should match the expected formula"
"Test","Batch with long messages should include segmentation information","Functional","Given the communication module is accessible
Given I prepare a batch of messages with varying lengths
When I submit the SMS request to verify segmentation
Then the SMS response should have status code 200
And the response should include segment count information for each message
And each segment count should match the expected formula"
"Test","Verify segmentation formula is correctly applied","Functional","Given the communication module is accessible
Given I prepare a standard SMS message request for DEV-997
And I set message content to be exactly 153 characters
When I submit the SMS request to verify segmentation
Then the SMS response should have status code 200
And the response should report 1 segment"
"Test","Verify segmentation formula for message just over segment boundary","Functional","Given the communication module is accessible
Given I prepare a standard SMS message request for DEV-997
And I set message content to be exactly 154 characters
When I submit the SMS request to verify segmentation
Then the SMS response should have status code 200
And the response should report 2 segments"
