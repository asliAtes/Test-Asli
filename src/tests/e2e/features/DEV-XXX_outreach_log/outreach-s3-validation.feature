Feature: Outreach Log File Validation
  As a system administrator
  I want to validate outreach log files
  So that I can ensure they meet our requirements

  @format-compliance
  Scenario: Validate log file format compliance
    Given an outreach log file is available for validation
    When I validate the file format
    Then line endings should be CR+LF
    And file name should follow the convention
    And file structure should be intact
    And headers should be valid

  @data-quality
  Scenario: Validate log file data quality
    Given an outreach log file is available for validation
    When I validate the file content
    Then there should be no null values
    And field formats should be valid
    And data types should be consistent
    And all required fields should be present

  @process-reliability
  Scenario: Validate daily log generation
    Given today's outreach log file
    When I check the generation timestamp
    Then it should be generated within the expected timeframe
    And it should follow weekend generation rules
