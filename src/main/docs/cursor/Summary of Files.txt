Summary of Files:Cohort file (USCC > Kredos)Performance file (USCC > Kredos) Confirmation File (Kredos > USCC)PA File for Care Team (Kredos > USCC)PA File for Billing / Amdocs (Kredos > USCC)Summary / Outreach File (Kredos > USCC)Exiting File (Kredos > USCC)Message Template file (NO Knockout files)Updated Nov 15, 2024Adding a new field to the Cohort File:USCC Data Specs Confirmation 111524.xlsx  Sample file that includes the PayPropensityScore field:KAI_cohort_20241119_174257_TEST2  1. A Propensity-to-Pay score will be added to the daily ‘cohort’ file-a. Field name: PayPropensityScoreb. Field format: Numerical, range 0—5, with four decimal digits (e.g. 2.7128).2. Model development information that may be helpful-a. The scoring model was developed on accounts entering collections. The target variable was defined with the ‘6-month involuntary cancel’ criteria, with the 6-month window starting from the day of entry to collections. In other words, the model predicts the probability that a customer will not involuntarily canceled at the end of the six month period starting from collections entry. We then multiply the predicted probability by 5 to fit the score range of 0—5 for the cohort file.b. Higher scores mean higher probabilities to pay.3. Operational Details-a. Although the model was developed on collections entries only, the scoring algorithm can be applied to the full base, so we should be able to score almost everyone in the cohort even on day one.(NOTE: The above information is different from what I communicated at the initial meeting earlier this week.)3. We plan to score the base daily using the customers’ information as of that day, so the scores in the cohort file may change from one day to the next. Updated Version Sept 30 2024Changes:Exiting File Updates, removing some fields from the exiting file and providing more detail on how we will define the fields and population:USCC Data Specs Confirmation 093024.xlsx  For the exiting file, please use the following fields:AccountKey: Pull FinAcctNum from Cohort filePlacementDate: Pull PlacementDate from Cohort fileStatus: CustomerStatus? Populate "A", "C", or "S" for active canceled suspended; pull from Cohort fileResolutionStatus: Enter "OnHold" for all recordsCollEndTreatmentDate: Pull CollEndTreatmentDate from Cohort fileHoldType: Indicate either “EarlyCure” or “Evaluated” for all records Note: We are removing the following fields, which are unnecessary:CollSchedSuspDate, CollSchedCanDate, CollSchedWriteOffDate, CollSchedAgencyDate, CollNextStepStatus Logic for who is included in the file: All unique combinations of FinAcctNum + PlacementDate that had been included in a Cohort File during the prior month, based on the file date. (Only the prior month; do not go back to program launch)  Logic for who is indicated as “EarlyCure” (everyone else will be “Evaluated”):EarlyCure is defined by a unique combination of FinAcctNum + PlacementDate whose CollInd (on the Cohort file) changed to T on a file date that is EnterCollDate + 1 or EnterCollDate +2(only use the date stamp; not the time stamp - the exact hours don’t matter)Updated Version: Aug 1, 2024Open USCC Data Specs Confirmation 080124.xlsxUSCC Data Specs Confirmation 080124.xlsx02 Aug 2024, 12:37 AMChanges:For each of the two Payment Arrangement Files (Bulk_PA and Payment_Extensions), we would like to change the frequency so that they generate once every hour, every day (7 days a week).JIRA: https://kredosai.atlassian.net/browse/DEV-447 @Inder Dhir @Shivaprasad MJ @Balaji Sridharan @Dave Thoms  Updated Version: July 30, 2024Open USCC Data Specs Confirmation 073024.xlsxUSCC Data Specs Confirmation 073024.xlsx30 Jul 2024, 08:12 PMChange: Please include a blank record (row) for every Outreach Log, including empty files that only include the headers.@Shivaprasad MJ @Balaji Sridharan @Dave Thoms Updated Version: July 23, 2024:USCC Data Specs Confirmation 072324.xlsx Exiting File: Customers_DataWe’d like to start sending the Existing File (Customers_Data) to USCC following the specs included here.There are two major changes:1. For the HoldType field:a. LIST 1: Make a list of all unique combinations of FinAcctNum + EnterCollDate. b. LIST 2: “Evaluated” Make a separate list of all FinAcctNum + EnterCollDate in which EnterCollDate is at least two days prior to the file date. And the difference between these two lists are the “EarlyCure” c. Example: We received on 7/23 a file which has the following records. E.g. Record 1 is EnterCollDate 7/23, Record 2 is EnterCollDate 7/23, Record 3 is EnterCollDate 7/22, Record 4 is EnterCollDate 7/21, Record 5 is EnterCollDate 7/20, Record 6 is EnterCollDate 7/20. List 1 should include all 6 records. List 2 should include only Record 4, Record 5, and Record 6. 2. Please schedule this to run monthly (3rd of the month, starting Aug 3) And this will capture all of the FinAcctNums + EnterCollDate combinations from the month prior (for example, July 1 - 31)The end product should be a single file indicating either “EarlyCure” or “Evaluated” for all records. @Shivaprasad MJ NO ACTION NEEDED - will discuss internally and with client before making changes: Exiting File: Customers_Data 1.

We're looking into the root cause of this right now. If Gunnu has other specific inconsistencies that have occured in the last month or so, he is welcome to send any additional thoughts or concerns that he's seeing, in case we don't see it on our side.That being said, I know the outreach log has been an ongoing source of inconsistencies and manual updates. We have a new QA expert that is going to set up automated tests to detect the unwanted null values, as well as any of the other prior issues, such as the CR+LF and .crlf format issues, and ensuring that there's an empty row at the end of the file, etc. I will send another update tomorrow as I know more.IssueNull Values in Outreach LogDate IdentifiedMar 4, 2025 What Happened / How Was It Discovered:Gunnu noticed that there were a few null records included on the outreach log for Feb 27 2025ImpactThere were 3 null values at the start of the outreach log.

As part of a security upgrade, the version of the third party library was upgraded which changed the default line ending from CR+LF to only LF. While the security upgrade was tested extensively for logic and data, the current tests did not catch that the line ending changed.Interim FixWe uploaded a file that was manually corrected and then implemented a permanent (automated) fix.Resolution & Prevention:To fix the issue, Kredos added explicit configuration to use CR + LF as the line ending. In addition, Kredos also added tests to verify the line ending of the data file.Resolution DateNov 23, 2024 DEV-###DEV-674 Client-Facing SummaryUSCC 112224 RCA CR LF Outreach Log.docx IssueSFTPCloud DownDate IdentifiedNov 8, 2024 What Happened / How Was It Discovered:Discovery: Michael Randolph at USCC let us know (8:17am PT) they couldn’t connect to the sftp.uscc.kredosai.com server - they were getting an authentication error. T-Mobile also later reported they were having issues. Lane also notified Kredos at 8:22am PT that a Bulk PA file was missing. Notes from Inder (Internal): https://kredosai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KredosAIDo/pages/231571457 ImpactFiles were not able to be transferred in either direction, causing a delay in the cohort file as well as PA files.Root CauseWe had switched over the owner on our SFTP which deleted the instance and users.Message from Adrian at SFTPCloud: “The problem was caused by an issue with our payment provider and it was triggered when we changed the owner. The issue is now fixed and to improve things for the future, we will update our metadata backup policy to allow us to restore the users of an instance instantly.”Interim FixN/AResolution & Prevention:Michael at USCC confirmed at 9:51am PT that the SFTP connection was working again. Lane also confirmed at 10:23am PT that he received the Bulk PA files that he had been missing. Resolution: Kredos needed to re-create the instance and users in SFTP cloud. From Inder to SFTP Cloud: “Our customers are using our DNS names which are CNAMEd to our SFTPCloud instance domain, so it works well.It would be good to offer some sort of built in external monitoring of the SFTP instances into the platform.The change took place several hours ago but we found out only when our customers complained.The SFTPCloud already has the connection and usernames, so the external monitoring only needs a password/private key - which could be integrated into the existing UI. The key thing is for that monitoring to be executed outside of your existing infrastructure - so that it mimicks an actual SFTP Client.I’m sure all of your customers will appreciate this optional additional monitoring feature if you offer it, and your platform will benefit from the additional trust and reduced MTTR in case of unexpected failures like this one.”Resolution DateNov 8, 2024 DEV-###https://kredosai.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KredosAIDo/pages/231571457 Client-Facing SummaryUSCC 110824 RCA SFTP Connection.docx   IssueReturn File Was Not Sent (Didn’t process on time)Date IdentifiedOct 23, 2024 What Happened / How Was It Discovered:Vassar notified us the morning of 10/23 that the Return File took too long to process the night before, so it never got sent (the 10/22 file).

Here's the overview of what's happening:The return file started yesterday but was unexpectedly slow in processing, and didn't complete on time. Our dev team identified the root cause, and have a plan in place to return to normal processing speeds. They are working on the solution right now and will test in staging first, to confirm everything is working as expected.They plan to launch the fix in production on Friday, meaning that we would have the return files working again by Friday evening.We will also be sending retroactive files for the three days that are impacted by this (Tues, Wed, and Thurs) so no data is missed.Issue20k+ PA records from spinning processDate IdentifiedAug 23, 2024What Happened / How Was It Discovered:When presenting weekly data, we noticed that the PA completion %s were way over 100%. In digging into the raw data, Dave discovered that a couple PAs had over 20k records associated with them. “We noticed this morning that the August vintage showed more than 100% PA setup rate, so I was just looking at the performance file to see if I could understand what was happening.  What I found is that a single account has 20,560 separate PA setup records— all with very slightly different timestamps— for exactly the same amount of $89.78 on 8/14.”This was caused by two PA links going to the same customer on different days and when they set up two different PAs, this data caused a looping effect in the USCC system. Notified Client during call on Aug 21, 2024. Dave followed up by email with account details:Following up on the examples I mentioned in our call:852825301 on 8/17855625072 on 8/14Both had over 20k PA set instances on those days.   ImpactUSCC’s system went into a loop. From Ryan: “Because the API call that processes the Bulk PA file is multithreaded, this has led to separate threads picking up the two records and causing a lock, and it gets caught in an infinite loop trying to reprocess the records. This leads to the accounts creating around 300k payment arrangement entries and 1.2mil memos, which is further causing issues when the account is viewed in CIM as it can crash the ABP and CRM/UIF weblogics due to volume”Root CauseCustomer selected multiple PAs (from separate links) and these conflicting entries caused the excessive records to be produced.Interim FixIdentifying the full scope of the issue, correcting the data in reporting. USCC is also implementing a patch on their side.Resolution & Prevention:Kredos will implement additional de-duping logic on both sides.USCC is also implementing new de-duping logic.Kredos will recommend how to handle duplicates: highest amount, lowest amount, most recent, etc.Resolution Date DEV-### Client-Facing SummaryWe discussed in our client call on Aug 28.From Ryan on Sept 4:There were duplicate payment arrangements in the PA Bulk files -- 852825301 on the 17th and 855625072 on the 15th. Because the API call that processes the Bulk PA file is multithreaded, this has led to separate threads picking up the two records and causing a lock, and it gets caught in an infinite loop trying to reprocess the records. This leads to the accounts creating around 300k payment arrangement entries and 1.2mil memos, which is further causing issues when the account is viewed in CIM as it can crash the ABP and CRM/UIF weblogics due to volume.We’re opening an internal defect to enhance the script to clean duplicate entries from the file, as well as a patch defect (below) to clean up the duplicate data from collections and memos and leave only the most recent record. In the meantime, can you please work with your internal teams to also implement some duplicate checks prior to sending the file?Please let us know how you want us to handle potential records if we have the same account number but different amounts (so the input record won’t be a true duplicate line).

Dave responded that the file had been delayed.At 9:17am CT, Michael also notified Kredos that the KAI_Payment_Extensions_20240802080829.txt.pgp file could not be decrypted.ImpactBoth 8:00am PA files (Bulk PA and Payment Extensions) were unable to be decrypted. Root CauseWe were testing a scheduler process that had to do with encryption and that needed to be tested in production.  The intent was for that test to be completed overnight prior to the generation of files, but the test went longer than expected and impacted the generation of the PA files at 8:00 AM Central time, resulting in a delivery delay and encryption with a test key.  No other processes were impacted, and those files have since been corrected and placed into the SFTP server. Interim FixN/AResolution & Prevention:Kredos uploaded new files with the correct encryption key.

We don’t allow for more than one file to process in a day2. The DUN computation logic would change for yesterdays file given the date change, and that would have resulted in 2 messages going out to the same folks today. So this will be treated as an unplanned holiday (like Sunday) for the systemIt would be ideal to have better alerts in place so we can identify these issues sooner - TBD on thisResolution DateJul 25, 2024 DEV-### Client-Facing SummaryOpenIssue Summary: Kredos discovered on 7/24 that no messages had gone out that day and that the file processing was spinning.Timeline: Discovered on 7/24/24. Resolved overnight on 7/24/24. Processes confirmed to be working as expected on 7/25/24. Kredos notified USCC on 7/25/24.Root Cause: There was a configuration bug within the code that was deployed on Sunday, 7/21/24. It was a volume-related bug that was unique to some of the customization we’ve put in place here.Impact: Messages scheduled for 7/24 were not sent, and were not rescheduled for the following day. (They were skipped.) The sequencing that Kredos has in place is very resilient, so a single missed message is expected to have very minimal impact.Preventative Measures: Configuration has been updated to resolve the bug. Kredos will be monitoring the file processing for the near future to ensure the fix is working as expected. Kredos is also developing updates to automated alerts in order to identify file processing errors sooner, allowing all parties to react sooner as well.IssueCohort file didn’t process due to “major fault”Date Identified17 Jun 2024What Happened / How Was It Discovered:File did not process - was notified by file alert emailImpactMinimal; we were able to re-processesRoot CauseThere was a comma in the last name field “Jr, XXX” that affected that row and following rows to be structured incorrectly. USCC had included quotes around the value correctly, so Kredos needed to update code to pull this value correctly.Interim FixKredos made updates to file and reprocessed it so that the cohort data was successfully processed.Resolution & Prevention:Kredos updated the code to correctly consume values that include a comma in a within a single value of a comma-delimited file when quotes are surrounding those contentsResolution Date17 Jun 2024DEV-### Issue70 records did not receive sequencesDate Identified17 Jun 2024What Happened / How Was It Discovered:Kredos found while auditing the processing results from the first cohort fileImpactMessages did not go out to some usersRoot CauseThese were primarily related to voluntary cancel, in which users when from C > S (Cancel to Suspend)Interim Fix Resolution & Prevention:They were canceled records in the case of voluntary cancels. We need to confirm that we’ve changed the scenario logic for voluntary cancel, and these people will go into the Presuspend scenario.Dave is checking on 6/24 in the transformation file that the scenario for voluntary cancel goes to presuspend instead of cancel.Confirmed on 6/24 that new logic has been implemented.Resolution Date24 Jun 2024DEV-### IssueSome users received duplicate messages in the same dayDate Identified17 Jun 2024What Happened / How Was It Discovered:Kredos found while auditing the messages that were sent out for launch dayImpactNot the desired user experienceRoot CauseThe issue was a bug in how we were managing the queue for messages to be sent later in the day after the send window opened for some time zonesInterim Fix Resolution & Prevention:This cause a subset of the ones that were in the delayed queue to be entered into the queue twice* We deployed a fix last night (night of Jun 19)* There were no instances of duplicates today.  Confirmed by Dave on Jun 20 that duplicate issue was resolvedResolution Date20 Jun 2024DEV-### IssueUsers received messages before day 3 of delinquencyDate Identified18 Jun 2024What Happened / How Was It Discovered:Jessica / Jie as USCC noticed that 32 people received messages when they had just been placed into delinquency the day priorImpactUsers may have cured extra early Root CauseThere was a user journey that wasn’t fully captured in the ScenarioInterim Fix Resolution & Prevention:Kredos implemented new logic in how the cohort file is being transformed to be processed::= IF PayArrInd == 'P' THEN 'PA'; ELSEIF CustomerStatus == 'A' THEN 'PreSuspend'; ELSEIF CustomerStatus == 'S' THEN 'Suspended'; ELSEIF (CustomerStatus=='C' AND CollNextStep=='S' AND NOT (PayArrInd == 'P')) THEN 'PreSuspend'; ELSEIF CustomerStatus == 'C' THEN 'Canceled'; ELSE 'exception’Resolution Date DEV-### IssueExtra cohort file sent to Kredos by accidentDate Identified18 Jun 2024What Happened / How Was It Discovered:Kredos found in SFTP and Ryan sent an email shortly afterwardImpactKredos process worked as designedRoot Cause Interim Fix Resolution & Prevention:Kredos plans to implement additional logic that limits to one file per dayResolution Date DEV-### IssueEnterCollDate errorsDate Identified19 Jun 2024What Happened / How Was It Discovered:Kredos discovered some records were not processingImpact Root Cause* As part of consuming the cohort file, we have a process that evaluates any field we’ve identified as mandatory to ensure that it is populated and in the proper format* One of the mandatory fields was EnterCollDate, and our process was inadvertently reformatting the field on some of the records in the file and then rejecting those records as having the wrong formatInterim Fix Resolution & Prevention:Kredos updated the codeResolution Date21 Jun 2024DEV-### IssueBulk PA file pulling CustomerID rather than FinAcctNumDate Identified20 Jun 2024What Happened / How Was It Discovered:Kredos found while auditing the first Bulk PA records that the EntityID was pulling in CustomerID rather than FinAcctNum.

I cannot recall why we implemented this - perhaps to ensure that improper records don't trigger multiple messages? . However, this is causing issues in the re-assignment logic. So, while the STOP condition was successfully fixed (i.e., sequence reassignment happens even after the last message in the sequence has been sent), and the sequence re-assignment happened as expected in the test, no PA message got sent out as the DUN for the PA scenario was greater than the DUN for the pre-suspend scenario -I suggest we get rid of this constraint - the only implication is that should we for some reason get a corrupt record which shows increasing DUN, there would be messages that go out of order - For example , If a ban with Policy_901 shows up with a DUN of 30 - a reminder should go outIf the ban continues to be delinquent and shows up with a DUN of say 15 - a non-responder message goes outif the ban continues to be delinquent and for some reason shows up again with a DUN of 30 -- a reminder sms will go out -- as there will be no DUN check in the system - i think this is fineGoal is to confirm that removing the constraint fixes this problemTesting start date: 07/01/24File used for testing:OpenExpected behavior: Two messages should be delivered to people on the file Outcome / results: Note: PA Link was not working: Went to 401 error.
